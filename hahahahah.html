        <h1>Soyou</h1>   
        <p>A skilled exorcist blessed with the power of the Immortal Nuo., Mobile Legends: Bang Bang hero Suyou wields both mortal and immortal powers to overwhelm his enemies.

            The Mask of the Immortal has two forms. Tapping a skill puts him in his mortal form, giving him a speed boost. Holding a skill changes him to his immortal form, increasing his attack range and reducing damage based on his extra Physical Attack.
            
            </p> 
            <p>Unlike typical assassins, he doesnt have high burst damage, so timing and positioning his skills are key. His multi-hit abilities are very effective against heroes with low mobility, and he can sustain himself in long fights.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Suyou’s skills in Mobile Legends</h2>
        <h3>Passive: Transient Immortal</h3>
        <p>Tap-casting any skill will put Suyou in his Mortal form, grant him Movement Speed, and decrease the interval between Basic Attack.

            Hold-casting any skill will put Suyou in his Immortal form, increasing the damage of Basic Attacks and granting him Damage Reduction. In this form, for every certain amount of extra Physical Attack Suyou has, he gains Damage Reduction capped at a maximum percentage.</p>

        <h2>First skill – Blade Surge</h2>
        <p>Tap: Suyou throws his weapon in the target direction, dealing Physical Damage to enemies in its path. Suyou then blinks to the weapon’s location, catches it, and performs a slash in the opposite direction, dealing Physical Damage.

            Hold: Suyou channels the Immortal’s power and charges in the target direction, dealing Physical Damage to enemies along the path. When hitting an enemy hero, he stops and stuns enemies in a rectangular area in front for a quick duration. The charge increases distance with the hold time. Suyou can be controlled while charging, but the skill cannot be interrupted.</p>
        <h2>Second skill – Soul Sever</h2>
        <p>Tap: Suyou performs a sweeping attack with his weapon, dealing Physical Damage equal to a percentage of target’s Lost HP to enemies in a fan-shaped area.

            Hold: Suyou channels the Immortal’s power to perform several cleaves in a fan-shaped area. The first strikes deal Physical Damage each, while the final strike deals more Physical Damage and recovers HP for himself.</p>
            
            <h2>Third skill – Evil Queller</h2>
            <p>Tap: Suyou glides backward and swings his weapon in the target direction, dealing Physical Damage to enemies in a rectangular area and on his path backward, and reducing their Movement Speed for a while.</p>
            <p>Hold: Suyou uses the Immortal’s power to shoot a deadly arrow in the target’s direction, dealing Physical Damage to the target hit. The range increases with the hold time. Suyou can be controlled while charging, but the skill cannot be interrupted.</p>
            <br>
